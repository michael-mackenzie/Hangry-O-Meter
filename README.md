# Hangry-O Meter

A live emotion detector that tells you how much food the person sitting in front of the camera needs to not be hangry anymore!

## Using the app

1. Give your web browser access to your webcam:

<kbd>
  <img src="../master/photos/allow.GIF" />
</kbd>

2. Look into the camera and express your current emotion:

<kbd>
  <img src="../master/photos/transition.gif" />
</kbd>

3. View results of how much food you need to consume to rectify your hangryness!
